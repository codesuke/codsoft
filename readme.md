## Tasks Overview

### Task 1 & Task 2 — Portfolio Landing Page

For the first two tasks, I built a responsive and modern Portfolio Landing Page.

- Task 1: Creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML is a popular beginner web development
  project.
- Task 2: LANDING PAGE

The result is a personal portfolio designed to be both functional and visually appealing across devices.
